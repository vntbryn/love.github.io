           Love, I know we've been through so much recently, but we stayed together no matter how hard everything and how difficult things get. It didn't matter what came, and what will come to us, we fixed, we stayed and we chose each other no matter how hard it got for us. I will choose you everyday over anyone, baby. If you don't like anyone who I'm with, I will cut them off for you with no hesitation that's because I'm all yours, and only yours to keep. Every part of my being for you to claim. No matter how many I get upset and we get upset at each other, my love for you won't lessen. I won't ever get tired of you, love. You will always be my only one. Thank you for being patient with me even though I'm sensitive at times. Thank you for being such a wonderful and understanding woman that you are. Thank you for doing so much. I can't explain how grateful I am to you for entering my life. Don't be shy to ask for anything, my love. If I can do or give it, I won't hesitate to do so. I hope for us to have a more transparent, honest, happy, loving, auspicious and intimate relationship. I hope that you can adjust and be more comfortable with me soon, but, I'm not rushing so you can take your time. Although, there will be times that I will seem impatient so please understand and be patient with me when that time comes. I think that I'm not a perfect guy as you say that I am, I'm just trying to using my past mistakes as a lesson to be a much better man and a boyfriend for you. I got you and you're my woman now, love and I'm never letting go of you. I love you so much, my baby, my honey, my lovey, my sweetheart, my sweetie, my darling, my queen, my princess, my wifey, my girl, my woman, the love of my life, my girlfriend, my babe, my dear, my honeybunchsugarplum, my person, my woman, my property, my person and especially my love
