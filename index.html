           Love, I know we've been through so much recently, but we stayed together no matter how hard everything and difficult things get. It didn't matter what came and what will come to us, we fixed and we stayed and we chose each other no matter how hard it got for us. I will choose you everyday over anyone, baby. If you don't like anyone who I'm with, I will cut them off for you with no hesitation that's because I'm all yours, and only yours to keep. Every part of my being for you to claim. No matter how any I get upset and we get upset at each other, and love for you won't lessen. I won't ever get tired of you, love. You will always be my only one. Thank you for being patient with me even though I'm sensitive at times. Thank youfor being such a wonderful and understanding woman that you are. Thank you for doing so much. I can't explain how grateful I am to you for entering my life. Don't be shy to ask for anything, my love. If I can do or give it, I won't hesitate to do so.
