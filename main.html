           Love, I know we've been through so muchrecently, but we stayed together no matter how hard everything and difficult things get. It didn't matter what came and what will come to us, we fixed and we stayed and we chose each other no matter how hard it got for us. I will choose you everyday over anyone, baby. If you don't like anyone who I'm with, I will cut them off for you with no hesitation that's because I'm all yours, and only yours to keep. Every part of my being for you to claim.
